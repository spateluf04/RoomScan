"""Rule-based energy-saving suggestions for the RoomScan live dashboard.

Pure-logic module (no I/O, no torch, no capture dependency) that turns a
{devices, totals} estimate -- the exact shape energy_estimator.estimate_room()
already returns -- into a short list of plain-English suggestions. Also
accepts an optional ``context`` dict for signals estimate_room() doesn't
carry (currently just live frame brightness), used by rules like the
"TV in a bright room" suggestion.

Modularity: every rule is a plain function ``(devices, totals, context) ->
List[str]`` listed in ``_RULES``; ``generate_recommendations()`` just runs
them in order and concatenates. Callers only depend on
``generate_recommendations()``'s ``(devices, totals, context) -> List[str]``
signature, so the whole rule set (or ``generate_recommendations`` itself) can
later be swapped for an ML/LLM-based recommender without touching call sites
in roomscan_dashboard.py or roomscan.py.

Same hackathon-grade-priors caveat as energy_estimator.py: these are
heuristics over typical-draw assumptions and simple frame/co-occurrence
signals, not measured or vision-verified behavior -- "bright room" is a
mean-luminance threshold, not confirmed daylight or confirmed idle state, and
the "cooling inefficiency" rule needs a fan + air conditioner detection pair
that the stock COCO-trained YOLOv8n weights energy_detector.py loads today
cannot produce (see config.ENERGY_CATALOG's comment on those two entries) --
it is wired up and unit-tested with synthetic counts, ready to fire once a
detector that recognizes those classes is plugged in.
