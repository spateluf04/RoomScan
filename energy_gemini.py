"""Gemini-vision-powered energy recommendations for RoomScan.

Optional enhancement over energy_recommendations.py's rule engine: sends the
best-confidence appliance crop photos from a finished scan to the Gemini API
and asks for photo-grounded, natural-language energy-saving suggestions,
instead of (or in addition to) the threshold/co-occurrence rules.

Enabled only when GEMINI_API_KEY is set in the environment -- never hardcode
a key here. Falls back to the rule engine on ANY failure (no key, the
google-genai package isn't installed, network error, timeout, malformed
response) so a live demo never hard-depends on the network. The google-genai
SDK is imported lazily inside _generate_content(), mirroring how
energy_detector.py lazily imports ultralytics, so every other function here
-- and every test in tests/test_energy_gemini.py -- works with the package
uninstalled.

get_recommendations() is the single public entry point and is only wired
into roomscan.py:build_report(), the once-per-finished-scan report. The live
dashboard's per-tick recommendations panel and its instant Stop-Scan summary
dialog call energy_recommendations.generate_recommendations() directly and
intentionally stay rule-based-only (see config.py's GEMINI_* comment).

Standalone smoke test (requires GEMINI_API_KEY + google-genai installed):
