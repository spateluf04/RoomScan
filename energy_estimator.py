"""Energy-use estimation from detected appliance counts.

Pure-logic module for the RoomScan energy audit: maps appliance class names
(COCO/YOLO names, as produced by energy_detector.py) through the wattage and
usage-hours priors in ``config.ENERGY_CATALOG`` to per-device and room-total
kWh/day, kWh/year, and yearly cost figures. No I/O, no torch, no capture
dependencies -- it is imported by roomscan.py and unit-tested directly.

The numbers are hackathon-grade typical-draw priors, not measurements; the
report layer is expected to label them as estimates.
